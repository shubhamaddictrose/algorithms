/*

1. Find max subset sum less than k
2. Find minimum cost for n jobs and n person with given cost matrix
3. Find k equal sum subsets
4. Travelling salesman problem


Process to solve these problems:

1. Do a bruteforce approach first - NP hard problem.
2. find the subset mask and use dp to memoize the answers.

OR

Kuch nhi smjh aa rha to dp with bitmask hi hoga... 💁‍♂️
