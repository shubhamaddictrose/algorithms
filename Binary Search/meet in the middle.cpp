// It s generally used when the input is near 40 i.e its time complexty is 2^n/2*log(2^n/2) = n*2^n/2

// In this first use divide and conquor and then use binary search.........

// example - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/meet-in-the-middle/

// Given a set of n integers where n <= 40. Each of them is at most 1012, 
// determine the maximum sum subset having sum less than or equal S where S <= 1018.

// divide krke binary search krke merge kro.
