
1. The expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values.

2. Each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value.

3. For continuous variable summation is replaced by integration and probability by probability density

4. The variance is a measure of dispersion of the possible values of the random variable around the expected value. The variance itself is defined in terms of two expectations: it is the expected value of the squared deviation of the variable's value from the variable's expected value.

5. E(X) = sum(Pi*Xi)
   When Pi is equal fo every values then simple average becomes the expected value

6. If an event is represented by a function of a random variable (g(x)) then that function is substituted into the EV for
   a continuous random variable formula to get:
   E[g(X)] = Sum(g(X)*P(X))
   P(X) is the Probability density function.
