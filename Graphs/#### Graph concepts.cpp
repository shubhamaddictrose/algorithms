/*

Directed graphs:

1. Try to use topological sorting if possible.
2. 


Undirected Graphs:

1. Ignore the parent and you can assume it to be a directed graph while traversal for many algorithms.
2. 


For Both:

1. You can also traverse the edges only if needed for a few algorithms like floyd-warshall and krushkal's
2. Use coloring of the node while traversal if needed, colors can be white (not visited yet), grey (in the queue/stack) or black (completely explored)
3. DSU can also be used sometimes. like detecting the cycles
4.
