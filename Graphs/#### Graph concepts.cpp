/*

Directed graphs:

1. Try to use topological sorting if possible.
2. 


Undirected Graphs:

1. Ignore the parent and you can assume it to be a directed graph while traversal for many algorithms.
2. 


For Both:

1. You can also traverse the edges only if needed for a few algorithms like bellman ford and krushkal's
2. Use coloring of the node while traversal if needed, colors can be white (not visited yet), grey (in process) or black (completely explored)
3. DSU can also be used sometimes. like detecting the cycles in krushkal's
4. 


Unweighted graphs:

1. bfs, dfs
3. topological sort
4. lca

Weighted Graphs:

1. Dijkstra's
2. bellman ford
3. floyyd warshall
4. 0-1 bfs
5. krushkal's mst using union find with no cycle
